    <p>
        In English, a denominal verb is formed by turning a noun into verb use. For example, denominal verbs are cases like "to dust" (which means "to clean the dust"), or "to google" (which means "to search something on Google").
    </p>
    <p>
        In this survey, you will annotate the meaning of denominal verbs by choosing alternative verbs that are appropriate substitutes of the denominal verbs.
        If none of the given alternative verbs is a good substitute, you will be expected to suggest an good alternative verb (in present tense) by typing into the box.
    </p>
    <p> Choices of alternative verbs are given in their present tense, and you don't need to transform them into correct tense during this survey.</p>

    <positive-example>
     <p>Given the following sentence: </p>
     <p>"The boy biked to school"</p>
     <p> You will be asked to check all verbs that you think are appropriate substitutes for the denominal verb "biked" in the query sentence,
     such that the paraphrased sentence would read as:
     <p> "The boy (your verb choice in past tense) the bike to school"</p>
     <p> In this case, the three verb choices are:</p>
     <p>a. ride</p>
     <p>b. go</p>
     <p>c. take</p>
     <p>You can check as many verbs as you'd like as long as the meaning of the paraphrased sentence is equivalent to the original query sentence. </p>
     <p>In this case, the appropriate choice would be "ride" (even though in some cases, there might be multiple correct choices). </p>
     <p>If you think none of the verbs applies, then you will be prompted to type a verb that you think best serves as the substitute.</p>
     </positive-example>

     <negative-example>
     <p> Consider another example:</p>
     <p>"I milked the cow."</p>
     <p>With the following incomplete paraphrase:</p>
     <p>"I (your verb choice in past tense)" milk from/out of the cow.</p>
     <p>Suppose you are given three choices to fill the blank above:</p>
     <p>a. drink</p>
     <p>b. see</p>
     <p>c. want</p>
     <p>In this case, none of the three candidate verbs serves as a good substitution because the paraphrased sentence would not express the equivalent meaning to the query sentence. So you could type in an alternative verb (in present tense), such as "draw".
     Since "I drew milk from/out of the cow" is a good paraphrase that is equivalent to the original query sentence "I milked the cow".</p>
